## Description 📕

This repository contains a collection of Ansible playbooks and roles that I use to manage my personal infrastructure.

Learning through doing, so this is a work in progress.

## How to use ❓

Remember this is built for ubuntu distros, since the docker installation has their repositories.

- Clone this repository
- Install ansible with `apt install ansible`
- Run `make <playbook>` to run the playbook
